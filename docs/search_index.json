Introduction This tutorial aims to introduce a variety of software and concepts related to detecting emerging pathogens from a complex host sample. The provided data and methods are derived from real-world data, but have been modified to either illustrate a specific learning objective or to reduce the complexity of the problem. Contamination and a lack of large and accurate databases render detection of microbial pathogens difficult. As a disclaimer, all results produced from the tools described in this tutorial and others must also be verified with supplementary bioinformatics or wet-laboratory techniques. 2. List of software for tutorial and its respective documentation fastp multiqc KAT Kraken2 Pavian MEGAHIT Quast NCBI blast The workshop machines already have this software installed within a conda environment, but to perform this analysis later on, you can make use of the conda environment located at environment.yml to install the necessary software. 3. Exercise setup 3.1. Copy data files To begin, we will copy over the exercises to ~/workspace. This let’s use view the resulting output files in a web browser. Commands cp -r ~/CourseData/module2/module2_workspace/ ~/workspace/ cd ~/workspace/module2_workspace/analysis When you are finished with these steps you should be inside the directory /home/ubuntu/workspace/module2_workspace/analysis. You can verify this by running the command pwd. Output after running pwd /home/ubuntu/workspace/module2_workspace/analysis You should also have a directory like data/ one directory up from here. To check this, you can run ls ../: Output after running ls ../ analysis data precomputed-analysis 3.2. Activate environment Next we will activate the conda environment, which will have all the tools needed by this tutorial pre-installed. To do this please run the following: Commands conda activate module2-emerging-pathogen You should see the command-prompt (where you type commands) switch to include (module2-emerging-pathogen) at the beginning, showing you are inside this environment. You should also be able to run one of the commands like kraken2 --version and see output: Output after running kraken2 --version Kraken version 2.17.1 Copyright 2013-2023, Derrick Wood (dwood@cs.jhu.edu) 3.3. Verify your workshop machine URL This exercise will produce output files intended to be viewed in a web browser. These should be accessible by going to http://xx.uhn-hpc.ca in your web browser where xx is your particular number (like 01, 02, etc). If you are able to view a list of files and directories, try clicking the link for module2_workspace. This page will be referred to later to view some of our output files. In addition, the link precompuated-analysis will contain all the files we will generate during this lab. 4. Exercise 4.1. Patient Background: A 41-year-old man was admitted to a hospital 6 days after the onset of disease. He reported fever, chest tightness, unproductive cough, pain and weakness. Preliminary investigations excluded the presence of influenza virus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and other common respiratory pathogens. After 3 days of treatment the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit, and 6 days following admission the patient was transferred to another hospital. To further investigate the cause of illness, a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected from the patient and metatranscriptomic sequencing was performed (that is, the RNA from the sample was sequenced). In this lab, you will examine the metatranscriptomic data using a number of bioinformatics methods and tools to attempt to identify the cause of the illness. Note: The patient information and data was derived from a real study (shown at the end of the lab). 4.2. Overview We will proceed through the following steps to attempt to diagnose the situation. Trim and clean sequence reads using fastp Filter host (human) reads with kat Run Kraken2 with a bacterial and viral database to look at the taxonomic makeup of the reads. Assemble the metatranscriptome with megahit Examine assembly quality using quast and possible pathogens with blast Assembly-free approach The first set of steps follows through an assembly-free approach where we will perform taxonomic classification of the reads without constructing a metagenomics assembly. Step 1: Examine the reads Let’s first take a moment to examine the reads from the metatranscrimptomic sequencing. Note that for metatranscriptomic sequencing, while we are sequencing the RNA, this was performed by first generating complementary DNA (cDNA) to the RNA and sequencing the cDNA. Hence you will see thymine (T) instead of uracil (U) in the sequence data. The reads were generated from paired-end sequencing, which means that a particular fragment (of cDNA) was sequenced twice–once from either end (see the Illumina Paired vs. Single-End Reads for some additional details). These pairs of cDNA sequence reads are stored as separate files (named emerging-pathogen-reads_1.fastq.gz and emerging-pathogen-reads_2.fastq.gz). You can see each file by running ls: Commands ls ../data Output emerging-pathogen-reads_1.fastq.gz emerging-pathogen-reads_2.fastq.gz We can look at the contents of one of the files by running less (you can look at the other pair of reads too, but it will look very similar): Commands less ../data/emerging-pathogen-reads_1.fastq.gz Output @SRR10971381.5 5 length=151 NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN + !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! @SRR10971381.7 7 length=151 NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN + !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! @SRR10971381.33 33 length=115 NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN + !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! @SRR10971381.56 56 length=151 CCCGTGTTCGATTGGCATTTCACCCCTATCCACAACTCATCCCAAAGCTTTTCAACGCTCACGAGTTCGGTCCTCCACACAATTTTACCTGTGCTTCAACCTGGCCATGGATAGATCACTACGGTTTCGGGTCTACTATTACTAACTGAAC + FFFFFFFAFFFFFFAFFFFFF6FFFFFFFFF/FFFFFFFFFFFF/FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFAFFFFFFFFFFFAFFFFF/FFAF/FAFFFFFFFFFAFFFF/FFFFFFFFFFF/F=FF/FFFFA6FAFFFFF//FFAFFFFFFAFFFFFF These reads are in the FASTQ, which stores a single read as a block of 4 lines: identifier, sequence, + (separator), quality scores. In this file, we can see a lot of lines with NNN... for the sequence letters, which means that these portions of the read are not determined. We will remove some of these undetermined (and uninformative) reads in the next step. Step 2: Clean and examine quality of the reads As we saw from looking at the data, reads that come directly off of a sequencer may be of variable quality which might impact the downstream analysis. We will use the software fastp to both clean and trim reads (removing poor-quality reads or sequencing adapters) as well as examine the quality of the reads. To do this please run the following (the expected time of this command is shown as # Time: 30 seconds). Commands # Time: 30 seconds fastp --detect_adapter_for_pe --in1 ../data/emerging-pathogen-reads_1.fastq.gz --in2 ../data/emerging-pathogen-reads_2.fastq.gz --out1 cleaned_1.fastq --out2 cleaned_2.fastq You should see the following as output: Output Detecting adapter sequence for read1... No adapter detected for read1 Detecting adapter sequence for read2... No adapter detected for read2 [...] Insert size peak (evaluated by paired-end reads): 150 JSON report: fastp.json HTML report: fastp.html fastp --detect_adapter_for_pe --in1 ../data/emerging-pathogen-reads_1.fastq.gz --in2 ../data/emerging-pathogen-reads_2.fastq.gz --out1 cleaned_1.fastq --out2 cleaned_2.fastq fastp v0.24.0, time used: 17 seconds Examine output You should now be able to nagivate to &lt; http://xx.uhn-hpc.ca/module2_workspace/analysis&gt; and see some of the output files. In particular, you should be able to find fastp.html, which contains a report of the quality of the reads and how many were removed. Please take a look at this report now: This should show an overview of the quality of the reads before and after filtering with fastp. Using this report, please answer the following questions. Step 2: Questions Looking at the Filtering result section, how many reads passed filters? How many were removed due to low quality? How many were removed due to too many N? Looking at the Adapters section, were there many adapters that needed to be trimmed in this data? Compare the quality and base contents plots Before filtering and After filtering? How do they differ? Step 3: Host read filtering The next step is to remove any host reads (in this case Human reads) from our dataset as we are not focused on examining host reads. There are several different tools that can be used to filter out host reads such as Bowtie2 or KAT. In this demonstration, we have selected to run KAT followed by Kraken2, but you could likely accomplish something similar by using Bowtie2 followed by Kraken2. Command documentation is available here KAT works by breaking down each read into small fragements of length k, k-mers, and compares them to a k-mer database of the human reference genome. Subsequently, the complete read is either assigned into a matched or unmatched (filtered) file if 10% of the k-mers in the read have been found in the human database. Let’s run KAT now. Commands # Time: 3 minutes kat filter seq -t 4 -i -o filtered --seq cleaned_1.fastq --seq2 cleaned_2.fastq ~/CourseData/module2/db/kat_db/human_kmers.jf The arguments for this command are: filter seq: Specifies that we are running a specific subcommand to filter sequences. -t 4: The number of threads to use (we have 4 CPU cores on these machines so we are using 4 threads). --seq --seq2 arguments to provide corresponding forward and reverse fastq reads (the cleaned reads from fastp) -i: Inverts the filter, that is we wish to output sequences not found in the human kmer database to a file. -o filtered Provide prefix for all files generated by the command. In our case, we will have two output files filtered.in.R1.fastq and filetered.in.R2.fastq. ~/CourseData/module2/db/kat_db/human_kmers.jf the human k-mer database we’re using made with jellyfish. As the command is running you should see the following output on your screen: Output Kmer Analysis Toolkit (KAT) V2.4.2 Running KAT in filter sequence mode ----------------------------------- Loading hashes into memory... done. Time taken: 40.7s Filtering sequences ... Processed 100000 pairs Processed 200000 pairs [...] Finished filtering. Time taken: 130.5s Found 1127908 / 1306231 to keep KAT filter seq completed. Total runtime: 182.8s If the command was successful, your current directory should contain two new files: filtered.in.R1.fastq filtered.in.R2.fastq These are the set of reads minus any reads that matched the human genome. The message Found 1127908 / 1306231 to keep tells us how many read-pairs were kept (the number in the filtered.in.*.fastq files) vs. the total number of read-pairs. Step 4: Classify reads using Kraken2 database Now that we have most, if not all, host reads filtered out, it’s time to classify the remaining reads to identify the likely taxonomic category they belong to. Database selection is one of the most crucial parts of running Kraken. One of the many factors that must be considered is the computational resources available. Our current AWS image for the course has only 16G of memory. A major disadvantage of Kraken2 is that it loads the entire database into memory. With the standard viral, bacterial, and archael database on the order of 50 GB we would be unable to run the full database on the course machine. To help mitigate this, Kraken2 allows reduced databases to be constructed, which will still give reasonable results but we may end up with more reads unclassified or classified at a higher taxonomic rank. We have constructed our own smaller Kraken2 database using only bacterial, human, and viral data. We will be using this database. Lets run the following command in our current directory to classify our reads against the Kraken2 database. Commands # Time: 1 minute kraken2 --db ~/CourseData/module2/db/kraken2_db --threads 4 --paired --output kraken_out.txt --report kraken_report.txt --unclassified-out kraken2_unclassified#.fastq filtered.in.R1.fastq filtered.in.R2.fastq This should produce output similar to below: Output Loading database information... done. 1127908 sequences (315.54 Mbp) processed in 5.332s (12693.3 Kseq/m, 3551.00 Mbp/m). 880599 sequences classified (78.07%) 247309 sequences unclassified (21.93%) Examine kraken_report.txt Let’s examine the text-based report of Kraken2: Commands less kraken_report.txt This should produce output similar to the following: 21.93 247309 247309 U 0 unclassified 78.07 880599 30 R 1 root 78.01 879899 124 R1 131567 cellular organisms 76.37 861411 19285 D 2 Bacteria 56.53 637572 2 D1 1783270 FCB group 56.53 637558 1571 D2 68336 Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi group 56.39 635982 1901 P 976 Bacteroidetes 55.10 621496 35 C 200643 Bacteroidia 55.09 621417 19584 O 171549 Bacteroidales 53.18 599872 2464 F 171552 Prevotellaceae 52.96 597396 397538 G 838 Prevotella 4.74 53473 53473 S 28137 Prevotella veroralis 4.34 48940 48940 S 1177574 Prevotella jejuni 2.56 28880 470 G1 2638335 unclassified Prevotella This will show the top taxonomic ranks (right-most column) as well as the percent and number of reads that fall into these categories (left-most columns). For example: The very first row 21.93 247309 247309 U 0 unclassified shows us that 247309 (21.93%) of the reads processed by Kraken2 are unclassified (remember we only used a database containing bacterial, viral, and human representatives). The 4th line 76.37 861411 19285 D 2 Bacteria tells us that 861411 (76.37%) of our reads fall into the Bacteria domain (the D in the fourth column is the taxonomic rank, Domain). The number 19285 tells us that 19285 of the reads are assigned directly to the Bacteria domain but cannot be assigned to any lower taxonomic rank (they match with too many diverse types of bacteria). More details about how to read this report can be found at https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2/wiki/Manual#sample-report-output-format. In the next step we will represent this data visually as a multi-layered pie chart. Examine kraken_out.txt Let’s also take a look at kraken_out.txt. This file contains the kraken2 results, but divided up into a classification for every read. Commands column -s$&#39;\\t&#39; -t kraken_out.txt | less -S column formats a text file (kraken_out.txt) into multiple columns according to a tab delimiter character (flag -s'$\\t') and produces a table (flag -t). Output C SRR10971381.56 29465 151|151 0:40 909932:2 0:8 909932:2 0:20 29465:4 0:7 178327&gt; C SRR10971381.97 838 122|122 0:44 2:5 0:23 838:1 0:10 838:2 0:3 |:| 0:3 838:2 0&gt; C SRR10971381.126 9606 109|109 0:2 9606:5 0:7 9606:1 0:12 9606:1 0:47 |:| 0:47 96&gt; C SRR10971381.135 838 151|151 0:95 838:3 0:19 |:| 0:15 838:1 0:12 838:5 0:6 838:&gt; C SRR10971381.219 1177574 151|151 0:11 838:3 0:5 838:2 0:9 838:5 0:11 838:1 976:5 83&gt; C SRR10971381.223 838 151|151 0:117 |:| 0:61 838:4 0:40 838:1 0:11 [...] This shows us a taxonomic classification for every read (one read per line). For example: On the first line, C SRR10971381.56 29465 tells us that this read with identifier SRR10971381.56 is classified C (matches to something in the Kraken2 database) and matches to the taxonomic category 29465, which is the NCBI taxonomy identifer. In this case 29465 corresponds to the Veillonella. More information on interpreting this file can be found at https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2/wiki/Manual#standard-kraken-output-format. Step 5: Generate an interactive html-based report using Pavian Instead of reading text-based files like above, we can visualize this information using Pavian, which can be used to construct an interactive summary and visualization of metagenomics data. Pavian supports a number of metagenomics analysis software outputs, including Kraken/Kraken2. To visualize the Kraken2 output we just generated, we can upload the kraken_report.txt file to the web application. Please do this now using the following steps: Download the kraken_report.txt to your local machine from http://xx.uhn-hpc.ca/module2_workspace/analysis (you can right-click and select Save as… on the file). Visit the Pavian website and click on Upload files &gt; Browse… and select the file kraken_report.txt we just downloaded. Select Generate HTML report … to generate the Pavian report. Open the generated report HTML file in your web browser. If all the steps are completed successfully then the report you should see should look like the following: Step 5: Questions What are the percentages of Unclassified, Microbial, Bacterial, Viral, Fungal, and Protozoan reads in this dataset? Scroll down to the Classification results section of the report and flip through the Bacteria, Viruses, and Eukaryotes tabs. What is the top organism in each of these three categories and how many reads? This data was derived from RNA (instead of DNA) and some viruses are RNA-based. If we focus in on the Viruses category, is there anything here that could be consistent with the patient’s symptoms? Given the results of Pavian, can you form a hypothesis as to the cause of the patient’s symptoms? Assembly-based approach Step 6: Metatranscriptomic assembly In order to investigate the data further we will assemble the metatranscriptome using the software MEGAHIT. What this will do is integrate all the read data together to attempt to produce the longest set of contiguous sequences possible (contigs).

Let’s take a look at this now: Commands ls megahit_out/ Output checkpoints.txt done final.contigs.fa intermediate_contigs log options.json It’s specifically the final.contigs.fa file that contains our metatranscriptome assembly. This will contain the largest contiguous sequences MEGAHIT was able to construct from the sequence reads. We can look at the contents with the command head (head prints the first 10 lines of a file): Commands head megahit_out/final.contigs.fa Output &gt;k141_0 flag=1 multi=3.0000 len=312 ATACTGATCTTAGAAAGCTTAGATTTCATCTTTTCAATTGGTGTATCGAATTTAGATACAAATTTAGCTAAGGATTTAGACATTTCAGCTTTATCTACAGTAGAGTATACTTTAATATCTTGAAGTACACCAGTTACTTTAGACTTAATCAAAATTTTACCCAAATCATTAACTAGATCTTTAGAATCAGAATTCTTTTCTACCATTTTAGCGATGATATCTGTTGCATCTTGATCTTCAAATGAAGATCTATATGACATGATAGTTTGACCTTCTTGTAGTTGAGATCCAACTTCTAAACATTCGATGTCT &gt;k141_785 flag=1 multi=6.0000 len=355 TATAGAGATAGGTGATAAGGTTTTCCTAGGCGCACAATCAGGTGTACCTGGAAGTTTGAAGGCTAATCAACAACTGATTGGTACACCTCCAATGGAGCAACGCTCTTACTTTAAGTCGCAAGCCATCTTCCGCAGACTGCCTGAGATGTACAAGCAACTAAGCGACTTGCAGAAAGAAATAGACCAATTGAAAAAGAACAGATAACATTCATGGATACAATAAAACAGAAGACATTAAAAGGGAGTTTCTCGCTCTTTGGCAAGGGACTTCACACAGGTTTGAGTCTTACCGTGACGTTTAATCCGGCTCCAGAGAATACTGGCTATAAGATACAACGTATAGATCTTGAGGGGC [...] It can be a bit difficult to get an overall idea of what is in this file, so in the next step we will use the software Quast to summarize the assembly information. Step 7: Evaluate assembly with Quast Quast can be used to provide summary statistics on the output of assembly software. Quast will take as input an assembled genome or metagenome (a FASTA file of different sequences) and will produce HTML and PDF reports. We will run Quast on our data by running the following command: Commands # Time: 2 seconds quast -t 4 megahit_out/final.contigs.fa You should expect to see the following as output: Output /home/ubuntu/.conda/envs/module2-emerging-pathogen/bin/quast -t 4 megahit_out/final.contigs.fa Version: 5.3.0 System information: OS: Linux-6.14.0-1016-aws-x86_64-with-glibc2.39 (linux_64) Python version: 3.9.23 CPUs number: 4 Started: 2025-11-19 15:50:27 [...] Finished: 2025-11-19 15:50:28 Elapsed time: 0:00:01.273336 NOTICEs: 1; WARNINGs: 0; non-fatal ERRORs: 0 Thank you for using QUAST! Quast writes it’s output to a directory quast_results/, which includes HTML and PDF reports. We can view this using a web browser by navigating to http://xx.uhn-hpc.ca/module2_workspace/analysis/ and clicking on quast_results then latest then icarus.html. From here, click on Contig size viewer. You should see the following: This shows the length of each contig in the megahit_out/final.contigs.fa file, sorted by size. (If it is having issues you can also see the needed information in the pdf report) Step 7: Questions What is the length of the largest contig in the genome? How does it compare to the length of the 2nd and 3rd largest contigs? Given that this is RNASeq data (i.e., sequences derived from RNA), what is the most common type of RNA you should expect to find? What are the approximate lengths of these RNA fragments? Is the largest contig an outlier (i.e., is it much longer than you would expect)? Is there another type of source for this RNA fragment that could explain it’s length? Possibly a Virus? Also try looking at the QUAST report (http://xx.uhn-hpc.ca/module2_workspace/analysis/quast_results/latest/ then clicking on report.html). How many contigs &gt;= 1000 bp are there compared to the number &lt; 1000 bp? Step 8: Use BLAST to look for existing organisms In order to get a better handle on what the identity of the largest contigs could be, let’s use BLAST to compare to a database of existing viruses. Please run the following: Commands # Time: 1 second seqkit sort --by-length --reverse megahit_out/final.contigs.fa | seqkit head -n 50 &gt; contigs-50.fa blastn -db ~/CourseData/module2/db/blast_db/ref_viruses_rep_genomes_modified -query contigs-50.fa -html -out blast_results.html As output you should see something like (blastn won’t print any output): Output [INFO] read sequences ... [INFO] 3112 sequences loaded [INFO] sorting ... [INFO] output ... Here, we first use seqkit to sort all contigs by length with the largest ones first (seqkit sort --by-length --reverse ...) and we then extract only the top 50 longest contigs (seqkit head -n 50) and write these to a file contigs-50.fa (&gt; contigs-50.fa). Note that the pipe | character will take the output of one command (seqkit sort --by-length ..., which sorts sequences in the file by length) and forward it into the input of another command (seqkit head -n 50, which takes only the first 50 sequences from the file). The greater-than symbol &gt; takes the output of one command seqkit head ... and writes it to a file (named contigs-50.fa). The next command will run BLAST on these top 50 longest contigs using a pre-computed database of viral genomes (blastn -db ~/CourseData/module2/db/blast_db/ref_viruses_rep_genomes_modified -query contigs-50.fa ...). The -html -out blast_results.html tells BLAST to write its results as an HTML file. To view these results, please browse to http://xx.uhn-hpc.ca/module2_workspace/analysis/blast_results.html to view the ouptut blast_results.html file. This should look something like below: Step 8: Questions What is the closest match for the longest contig you find in your data? What is the percent identify for this match (the value Z in Identities = X/Y (Z%)). Recall that if a pathogen is an emerging/novel pathogen then you may not get a perfect match to any existing organisms. Using the BLAST report alongside all other information we’ve gathered, what can you say about what pathogen may be causing the patient’s symptoms? It can be difficult to examine all the contigs/BLAST matches at once with the standard BLAST report (which shows the full alignment). We can modify the BLAST command to output a tab-separated file, with one BLAST HSP (a high-scoring segment pair) per line. To do this please run the following: Commands blastn -db ~/CourseData/module2/db/blast_db/ref_viruses_rep_genomes_modified -query contigs-50.fa -outfmt &#39;7 qseqid length slen pident sseqid stitle&#39; -out blast_report.tsv This should construct a tabular BLAST report with the columns labeled like query id, alignment length, subject length, % identity, subject id, subject title. Taking a look at the file blast_report.tsv, what are all the different BLAST matches you can find (the different values for subject title)? How do they compare in terms of % identity and alignment length (in general, higher values for both of these should be better matches)? 5. Final words Congratulations, you’ve finished this lab. As a final check on your results, you can use NCBI’s online tool to perform a BLAST on our top 50 contigs to see what matches to the contigs. The source of the data and patient background information can be found at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2008-3 (clicking this link will reveal what the illness is). The only modification made to the original metatranscriptomic reads was to reduce them to 10% of the orginal file size. While we used MEGAHIT to perform the assembly, there are a number of other more recent assemblers that may be useful. In particular, the SPAdes suite of tools (such as metaviralspades or rnaspades) may be useful to look into for this sort of data analysis. As a final note, NCBI also performs taxonomic analysis using their own software and you can actually view these using Krona directly from NCBI. Please click here and go to the Analysis tab for NCBI’s taxonomic analysis of this sequence data (clicking this link will reveal what the illness is). "],["module-3-pathogen-typing.html", "Module 3 Pathogen Typing Lecture Lab", " Module 3 Pathogen Typing Lecture Lab Introduction The scope of this practical session is to perform a core-genome multi-locus sequence typing (cgMLST) analysis, a genome-based molecular typing method widely adopted for genomic surveillance of bacterial species. Due to the widespread adoption of high-throughput whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and the advancement of this technology, it has been incorporated in many surveillance programs such as PulseNet Canada to monitor foodborne outbreaks. This practical is split into two sessions: cgMLST allele schema creation all through to allele calling, which will be conducted on your terminal to generate necessary input files for the next session Clustering of cgMLST data from chewBBACA and visualization in RStudio In this exercise, you will begin by generating cgMLST allele calls for a collection of 200 Staphylococcus aureus genomes (50 complete and 150 draft genomes) from NCBI RefSeq and BVBRC. PART ONE: chewBBACA Objective To create wgMLST and cgMLST schema for a collection of 200 MRSA Staphylococcus aureus genomes (50 complete genomes and 150 draft genomes) from NCBI RefSeq and BVBRC Activating Conda environment Before we begin, the software we need to conduct our analysis have already been installed on your instance using Conda. However, we need to activate this environment to use the necessary tools. # Activate conda environment to use chewBBACA and Prodigal conda activate chewie Create training file using Prodigal ChewBBACA requires a training file to predict genes and proteins for our species of interest. For this purpose, we are going to use the S. aureus USA300 reference genome to generate the training file. prodigal -i USA300ref.fasta -t Staphylococcus_aureus.trn -p single Create wgMLST schema using the complete genomes from NCBI Now that we have our training file, we will start by creating a whole-genome multi-locus sequence typing (wgMLST) schema based on the complete 50 S. aureus genomes from NCBI RefSeq chewBBACA.py CreateSchema -i genomes/NCBI-RefSeq-50 -o mrsa_schema --ptf Staphylococcus_aureus.trn --cpu 4 This will use the prodigal training file to identify CDS from the complete set of S. aureus genomes in NCBI and save them in the mrsa_schema folder The schema seed will be found in that folder with 3,389 identified loci. Allele Calling Next is to perform allele calling with the wgMLST schema that we created in the previous step. This will determine the allelic profiles of the strains we are analyzing by identifying novel alleles, which will be added to the schema. chewBBACA.py AlleleCall -i genomes/NCBI-RefSeq-50 -g mrsa_schema/schema_seed -o wgMLST_50 --cpu 4 Using a BLAST score ratio (BSR) of 0.6 and clustering similarity of 0.2, 13,762 novel alleles were identified, bringing the number of alleles in the schema to 17,151. Paralog Detection If you noticed from the previous results, 13 paralogs were identified. You can also find them in the paralogous_counts.tsv in the wgMLST_50 folder. It is important to remove these paralogs from the schema due to their uncertainty in allele calls. To do this run the following chewBBACA.py RemoveGenes -i wgMLST_50/results_alleles.tsv -g wgMLST_50/paralogous_counts.tsv -o wgMLST_50/results_alleles_NoParalogs.tsv By doing this, the new allelic profile without the paralogs are now saved in results_alleles_NoParalogs.tsv, which encompasses 3,376 loci cgMLST schema analysis After some QC, we can now determine how many loci are present in the core genome based on the allele calling results. This is based on a given threshold of loci presence in the genomes we analyzed. The ExtractCgMLST module uses 95%, 99%, and 100% to determine the set of loci in the core genome. chewBBACA.py ExtractCgMLST -i wgMLST_50/results_alleles_NoParalogs.tsv -o wgMLST_50/cgMLST If you look in the cgMLST folder, there is an interactive HTML line plot showing the cgMLST per threshold relative to the number of loci detected. From the plot, how many loci are present in the core genome at 95%? We would use this threshold to account for loci that might not be identified due to sequencing coverage and assembly issues. cgMLST assignment for 150 genomes These are 150 MRSA genomes with good quality from Australia pulled from BVBRC with associated metadata. Mislaballed species have been excluded. Using the 1,999 loci found in 95% core genomes, we will perfome Allele assignment on the 150 genomes chewBBACA.py AlleleCall -i genomes/BVBRC-150 -g mrsa_schema/schema_seed --gl wgMLST_50/cgMLST/cgMLSTschema95.txt -o BVBRC-150_results --cpu 4 At the end of the analysis, this added 13,244 novel alleles to the schema with no paralogs Convert Allele Calls To convert the allelic profiles into a suitable format that can be parsed into other tools, we need to convert the non-integers such as INF, ASM, PLOT3, and PLOT5 into integars chewBBACA.py ExtractCgMLST -i BVBRC-150_results/results_alleles.tsv -o BVBRC-150_results/cgMLST-150 PART TWO: cgMLST clustering Objective The purpose of this lab session is to take the cgMLST allele assignment that we have previously generated with chewBBACA and cluster them using Hamming distance matrix and allele thresholds. In addition, we would visualize our dataset using a dendrogram and annotate it with our cluster threshold and associated metadata. The overall goal is to infer genetic relatedness in our dataset by leveraging computational tools to investigate potential outbreaks and their potential sources. Getting Started We will begin by installing the necessary packages and helper script that we need to analyze our data. Note Every time you begin a new R session, you must reload all the packages and scripts! # install packages requiring BiocManager if (!requireNamespace(&#39;BiocManager&#39;, quietly = TRUE)) install.packages(&#39;BiocManager&#39;) if (!requireNamespace(&#39;ComplexHeatmap&#39;, quietly = TRUE)) BiocManager::install(&#39;ComplexHeatmap&#39;) if (!requireNamespace(&#39;treedataverse&#39;, quietly = TRUE)) BiocManager::install(&quot;YuLab-SMU/treedataverse&quot;) # install other packages required_packages &lt;- c(&quot;tidyverse&quot;, &quot;data.table&quot;, &quot;BiocManager&quot;, &quot;plotly&quot;, &quot;ggnewscale&quot;, &quot;circlize&quot;, &quot;randomcoloR&quot;, &quot;phangorn&quot;, &quot;knitr&quot;, &quot;purrr&quot;, &quot;scales&quot;, &quot;remotes&quot;,&quot;reactable&quot;, &quot;ggtreeExtra&quot;) not_installed &lt;- required_packages[!required_packages %in% installed.packages()[,&quot;Package&quot;]] if (length(not_installed) &gt; 0) { install.packages(not_installed, quiet = TRUE) } # load packages suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse)) suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(data.table)) suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(treedataverse)) suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly)) suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggnewscale)) suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ComplexHeatmap)) suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(circlize)) suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(randomcoloR)) suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(RColorBrewer)) suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(phangorn)) suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(knitr)) suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(purrr)) suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(scales)) suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(reactable)) suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggnewscale)) suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggtreeExtra)) ## source helper R scripts source(&quot;src/ggtree_helper.R&quot;) source(&quot;src/cluster_count_helper.R&quot;) source(&quot;src/cluster_helper.R&quot;) source(&quot;src/cgmlst_helper.R&quot;) Next read the cgMLST data from chewBBACA and the metadata into memory # read cgMLST and metadata aus_mrsa_cgMLST &lt;- read.delim(&quot;BVBRC-150_results/cgMLST-150/cgMLST95.tsv&quot;, sep = &quot;\\t&quot;) mrsa.data &lt;- read.csv(&quot;MRSA_AUS_metadata.csv&quot;, header = F) Having loaded our files, we need to make some adjustments to our metadata to make it suitable for our analysis. first, we are going to change the header, then we are going to create a new column for the host to exclude the taxon ID # change the header of the metadata file new.header &lt;- mrsa.data[2,] aus_mrsa_metadata &lt;- mrsa.data[-c(1,2),] colnames(aus_mrsa_metadata) &lt;- new.header head(aus_mrsa_metadata) aus_mrsa_metadata_reordered &lt;- aus_mrsa_metadata %&gt;% select(6, everything()) # move 6th column to the first position head(aus_mrsa_metadata_reordered) # Create a new Host column with just the host name aus_mrsa_metadata_reordered &lt;- aus_mrsa_metadata_reordered %&gt;% mutate(Host = str_remove(`host (common name)`, &quot;\\\\s*\\\\[.*\\\\]&quot;)) Can you spot the differences between the two metadata? Which one do you think we are going to use? Calculating the Hamming Distance The traditional approach for cgMLST analysis is based on computing pairwise distances between allele profiles as a proxy for the underlying genetic similarity between two isolates. Below, you are introduced to a distance metric called the Hamming distance, which is based on computing the number of differences between a pair of character vectors. The Hamming distance is useful for comparing profiles where a majority of characters are defined, such as profiles comprising core loci. Given two character vectors of equal lengths, the Hamming distance is the total number of positions in which the two vectors are different: Profile A: [ 0 , 2 , 0 , 5 , 5 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 ] Profile B: [ 0 , 1 , 0 , 4 , 3 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 ]   A != B: [ 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 ]    Hamming distance = sum( A != B ) = 3 In phylogenetic analysis, distance-based approaches are rather flexible in the sense that they can be constructed from any measure that estimates genetic similarity through the direct comparison of data points. In cgMLST, we compare allele profiles. In Mash, we compare k-mer profiles. In the context of two cgMLST profiles, the Hamming distance is calculated based on the number of allele differences across all loci as a proportion of total number of loci evaluated. Hamming distances will be computed in an all vs. all fashion to generate a pairwise distance matrix that will subsequently serve as the input for distance-based tree-building algorithms. Run the following code chunk: # use hamming helper function to compute pairwise Hamming distance of cgMLST data # compute Hamming distance # PATIENCE!!! this step might take several minutes depending on the size of the dataset mrsa.dist_mat &lt;- aus_mrsa_cgMLST %&gt;% column_to_rownames(&quot;FILE&quot;) %&gt;% t() %&gt;% hamming() # the dimension should be symmetric and should be the size of dataset (i.e. number of QC-passed genomes) dim(mrsa.dist_mat) Hierarchical Clustering of cgMLST profiles by Hamming distance In this section we will be performing hierarchical clustering of the Hamming distance matrix using the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (i.e. UPGMA) algorithm. Let’s cluster the Hamming distance matrix by running the code chunk below: # compute hierarchical clustering with hclust function and complete linkage method mrsa.hc &lt;- mrsa.dist_mat%&gt;% as.dist() %&gt;% hclust(method = &quot;complete&quot;) # reorder distance matrix according to the hc order mrsa.dist_mat &lt;- mrsa.dist_mat[mrsa.hc$order, mrsa.hc$order] # write reordered distance matrix to files dir.create(&quot;output/clusters&quot;, recursive = T) write.table(mrsa.dist_mat, file = &quot;output/clusters/dist_mat_ordered_cgmlst.tsv&quot;, quote = F, row.names = F, sep = &quot;\\t&quot;) Cluster extraction at multiple distance thresholds Identifying clusters of genomes sharing highly similar cgMLST profiles through the application of distance thresholds is a common practice in genomic surveillance and epidemiological investigations. These genomic clusters can become “analytical units” that can be tracked across space and time: The detection of a novel genomic cluster comprising isolates from multiple human clinical cases can signal the emergence of an outbreak, thus requiring a public health response in order to contain further cases. An examination of the evolving genomic cluster over time can provide important epidemiological insights on outbreak progression. The co-clustering of outbreak isolates with isolates from food/environmental sources can assist epidemiologists investigating an outbreak by linking the outbreak isolates to isolates from possible sources/reservoirs of the pathogen. Identifying cluster membership for every isolate in the dataset at multiple distance thresholds gives us the analytical flexibility to define suitable thresholds for analyzing the pathogen in question. From a practical perspective, a threshold that is too fine-grained will yield a large proportion of the dataset in singleton clusters, making it difficult to link outbreak isolates to one another and to potential outbreak sources. Conversely, using a threshold that is not fine-grained enough will fail to fully exploit the discriminatory power of genomic data, grouping outbreak and non-outbreak isolates indiscriminately. Adjusting similarity thresholds for cluster membership can be used to tweak the granularity of clusters: higher distance threshold produce larger clusters whereas lower distance thresholds will produce smaller clusters. A threshold of 0 will generate clusters with identical profiles. For membership at all possible distance thresholds, run the following code chunk: # Define genomic cluster membership at all possible distance thresholds mrsa.cgmlst_loci = (ncol(aus_mrsa_cgMLST)-1) ## maximum distance interval = 1 ## edit interval of interest; currently set to 1 then change to 10 to see how many thresholds are generated threshld &lt;- seq(0, mrsa.cgmlst_loci,interval) # extract cluster membership across multiple thresholds cluster_group &lt;- map(threshld, function(x) { mrsa.hc %&gt;% cutree(h = x) %&gt;% as.factor() }) # create name for each threshold names(cluster_group) &lt;- paste0(&quot;Threshold_&quot;, threshld) # print clustering results table, no duplicated names are allowed ( all.clusters &lt;- data.frame(cluster_group ) %&gt;% rownames_to_column(&quot;FILE&quot;) ) # reactable(clusters_all) # write file of genomic cluster memberships at multiple thresholds write.table(all.clusters, file = &quot;output/clusters/clusters_all.tsv&quot;, quote = F, row.names = F, sep = &quot;\\t&quot;) Questions: How many distinct thresholds are theoretically possible for this dataset? How would you determine the maximum number of allele differences across all genomes in the dataset based on the table above? hint: at some threshold, all genomes collapse to the same cluster… For membership at select distance thresholds, run the following code chunk: # Define genomic cluster membership at user-defined distance thresholds # Can either specify specific thresholds as a numeric vector i.e. c(0, 5, 10, 15) # If you&#39;re feeling lazy, you can also specify using c(seq(5, 100, 5)), which stands for &quot;go from threshold 5 to 100 in # increments of 5&quot;. You can also string multiple notations together within the same numerical vector. threshld &lt;-c(0, seq(5, 100, 5), seq(200, mrsa.cgmlst_loci, 100)) # currently reads as &quot;use threshold 0, # then from 5 to 100 in increments of 5 # then from 200 to maximum threshold # in increments of 100&quot; # extract cluster membership across multiple thresholds cluster_group &lt;- map(threshld, function(x) { mrsa.hc %&gt;% cutree(h = x) %&gt;% as.factor() }) # create name for each threshold names(cluster_group) &lt;- paste0(&quot;Threshold_&quot;, threshld) # print clustering results table, no duplicated names are allowed ( new_defined_clusters &lt;- data.frame(cluster_group ) %&gt;% rownames_to_column(&quot;FILE&quot;) ) # write file write.table(new_defined_clusters, file = &quot;output/clusters/new_defined_clusters.tsv&quot;, quote = F, row.names = F, sep = &quot;\\t&quot;) Questions: How many user-defined thresholds have we generated in the settings provided here? Which cluster does genome “1280_21738” belong to at a threshold of 25 allele differences? How would you determine how many different clusters were generated at each particular threshold? Distance matrix visulization via ordered heatmap A very useful visualization when dealing with distance matrices involves performing clustering, arranging the entries of the matrix based on the clustering order, and displaying the similarity as a heatmap. This produces a heatmap with a distinct 45 degree axis in which clusters of profiles with significant similarity representing possible clades/lineages can be plainly seen as “pockets of heat”. In this section of the lab, we will visualize the distance matrix using the ComplexHeatmap package and we will be comparing these clades to the MLST genotype information on the isolates by overlaying MLST information on the heatmap, which will allow us to examine whether the organism’s MLST is concordant with putative lineages defined by cgMLST similarity as displayed on the clustered heatmap. Let’s run the code chunk below: # create column annotations for heatmap # to display clade information set.seed(123) htmap_annot &lt;- aus_mrsa_metadata_reordered$genotype names(htmap_annot) &lt;-aus_mrsa_metadata$`BV-BRC genome ID` htmap_annot &lt;- htmap_annot[order(factor(names(htmap_annot), levels = rownames(mrsa.dist_mat)))] # create heatmap mrsa.dist_mat %&gt;% Heatmap( name = &quot;cgMLST\\nDistance&quot;, show_row_names = F, # do not display row labels show_column_names = F, # do not display column labels # use custom color gradient col = colorRamp2( c(min(mrsa.dist_mat), mean(mrsa.dist_mat), max(mrsa.dist_mat)), c(&quot;#f76c6a&quot;, &quot;#eebd32&quot;, &quot;#7ece97&quot;) ), # add column annotation to show MLST info overlaid on the clustered heatmap top_annotation = HeatmapAnnotation( MLST= htmap_annot, col = list( MLST = structure(brewer.pal(length(unique(htmap_annot)), &quot;Set3&quot;), names = unique(htmap_annot)) ) ) ) Annotated Dendrograms and cluster evaluation Here you will convert hierarchical clustering result (mrsa.hc) into a dendrogram using the as.phylo() function from the ape package. To visualize the resulting dendrogram, we will use the R package ggtree, which offers an extensive suite of functions to manipulate, visualize, and annotate tree-like data structures. In this section, you will be introduced to some of the different visual capabilities of ggtree and we will progressively update the same tree with several layers of visual annotations based on available metadata. Note that there is a massive amount of information in the internet dedicated to ggtree and all of its capabilities for advanced visualizations. Here we will barely scratch the surface. Circular vs. Rectangular dendrograms for simple tree visualization Radial vs. Rectangular dendrograms are different ways of visualizing a tree. Radial trees are capable of displaying a lot of simple data in a smaller footprint. In contrast, rectangular trees can display more complex data in a visualization that is easy on the eyes. Rectangular trees rendered as pdf format allow you to really zoom into sub-branches of the tree in greater detail when viewed in a pdf reader or in a browser window. This is essential when you’re dealing with larger datasets comprising hundreds of isolates such as the one we are dealing with here. Run the following code chunks to: Plot a circular tree of the entire dataset with the tree tips colored by MLST information.

Superimposing genomic cluster information onto dendrograms Let’s now superimpose the genomic cluster information on the previous dendrograms (Radial &amp; Rectangular) to examine whether the above code chunk for extracting cluster memberships at various thresholds has generated sensible cluster assignments. Run the code chunk below to insert text labels that span across tree tips assigned to the same clusters at a specified threshold. Interchange your threshold to 50 and 15 and see how it affects your cluster outcome. You can edit the target_threshold variable to examine how cluster membership changes in response to clustering distance cutoffs.

The data we are using comes from a classic study which demonstrated the utility of whole genome sequencing for investigating an MRSA outbreak within a Special Care Baby Unit (also known as a NICU) of the Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (CUH). Harris SR, Cartwright EJP, Török ME, et al. Whole-genome sequencing for analysis of an outbreak of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: a descriptive study. Lancet Infect Dis 2012 10.1016/S1473-3099(12)70268-2 This practical will step you through the genomic components of a typical nosocomial bacterial outbreak investigation, specifically: Identifying potential outbreak clusters Determining SNP distances Inferring outbreak phylogenies Performing transmission inference Background Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive coccoidal bacteria that forms a normal commensal member of the microbiome in 20-40% of people (Karsten, 2017). However, when skin and mucosal barriers are disrupted (e.g., through medical procedures such as catheterisation, tracheal tubes, surgeries) S. aureus can cause opportunistic invasive infections (Lee, 2018). Since the 1960s, variants have emerged and spread globally that are resistant to the majority of β-lactam antibiotics through the independent acquisitions of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) (IWG-SSC, 2009. This combination of commensal carriage, antimicrobial resistance, and healthcare-associated infection opportunities (along with additional virulence factors) have led to MRSA becoming a leading cause of hospital-associated mortality and morbidity globally (GBD, 2024). Therefore, tracking and preventing MRSA outbreaks is a major priority for infection prevention and control (IPAC or IPC) within hospital settings especially within the NICU due to the vulnerability of immunocompromised preterm infants and the high frequency of invasive procedures. This has led to adoption of genomic epidemiological approaches to detect MRSA outbreaks and track transmission links not apparent from traditional approaches alone (Blane, 2024). These sort of outbreak investigations are generally led by the infection prevention &amp; control (IPAC or IPC) team in a clinical setting or by the relevant public health team depending on the suspected infection source, geographic scale, and regional resource availability (e.g., Public Health Agency of Canada/Canadian Food Inspection Agency or provincial bodies like Public Health Ontario). Within the SCBU/NICU of Cambridge University Hopitals NHS Trust (and most hospitals) all inpatients are screened for MRSA carriage upon admission and once per week thereafter using culture-based or nucleic-acid based test. Specific IPAC policies and guidelines will determine criteria for initiating an outbreak investigation (e.g., a certain number of positive screens within a specific time and/or location). Routine surveillance has identified that 3 infants within the SCBU/NICU (P11-P13) are positive for MRSA carriage at the same time. Isolates from these 3 infants have also been shown to have the same pattern of antibiotic resistances. The IPAC team has therefore been activated to further investigate this as a suspected outbreak in the SCBU/NICU at CUH. They have performed a systematic review of all MRSA isolates from the SCBU/NICU over the preceding 6-12 months and identified a series of overlapping MRSA carriages with this same set of resistances. Due to multi-week gaps in the positive SCBU/NICU isolates they have also collected potentially matching MRSA isolates from parents and the wider hospital/community. To gain better insight into this potential outbreak and identify which of these isolates are linked by direct transmission chains, CUH have sequenced these isolates using 150bp paired-end reads via an Illumina MiSeq platform. You are a clinical bioinformatician who has been asked to support the investigation and analyses these genomes Set-Up This lab practical will involve running the following software: mlst poppunk ska gubbins IQTree GraphSNP &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: Bioinformatics in Practice Typically, most of these analyses would be run using a workflow such as bactopia that you are confident will reproducibly generate validated and verified outputs (ideally as part of your institution’s ISO15189 accreditation or equivalent). We will run the tools directly today so you get insight into what these workflows are actually doing! Data Using ssh connect to the provided analysis server instance: ssh -i YOUR_KEY.pem YOUR_USER@XX.uhn-hpc.ca Now create a folder in your ~/workspace and copy/link over the files you will need: mkdir -p ~/workspace/module4 cd ~/workspace/module4 cp -r ~/CourseData/module4/contextual_data.csv ~/CourseData/module4/SASCBU26_reference.fna . ln -s ~/CourseData/module4/assemblies . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: Contextual Data ‘Interpolation’ Specific collection dates were not available so have been inferred based on relative sampling gaps When you are finished with these steps you should be inside your work directory ~/workspace/module4. You can verify this by running the command pwd. s Output after running pwd ~/workspace/module4 You now see an assemblies/ folder in the current directory along with a contextual_metadata.tsv (all the contextual data needed for this analysis) and SASCBU26_reference.fna (the reference genome we will use later): Output after running lss SASCBU26_reference.fna assemblies contextual_data.csv Activate environment Next we will activate the pre-installed conda environment, which will have all the tools needed by this tutorial pre-installed. To do this please run the following: Commands conda activate outbreak You should see the command-prompt (where you type commands) switch to include (outbreak) at the beginning, showing you are inside this environment. You should also be able to run the mlst command like mlst --version and see output: Output after running mlst --version mlst 2.23.0 Find your IP address Similar to yesterday, we will want to either use the assigned hostname (e.g., xx.uhn-hpc.ca where xx is your instance number) or find the IP address of your machine on AWS so we can access some files from your machine on the web browser. To find your IP address you can run: Commands curl http://checkip.amazonaws.com This should print a number like XX.XX.XX.XX. Once you have your address, try going to http://xx.uhn-hpc.ca or http://IP-ADDRESS and clicking the link for module4. This page will be referred to later to easily download/view some of our output files. Cluster Identification All isolates that are putatively linked to the outbreak have been done so on the basis of time, location, and phenotype (specifically antibiotic susceptibilities). However, just because 2 isolates have the same resistance pattern does not mean they are closely related. Although this is a relatively small set of isolates we are often evaluating very large numbers of genomes for their potential connection to an outbreak. Additionally, most downstream outbreak analyses (such as transmission inference) perform best when applied to as little diversity as possible (i.e., just genomes from a single outbreak event). This means our first task is to identify and group which isolates are actually connect are likely to be linked using the sort of typing methods you encountered in the previous lab practical. This helps us to eliminate unrelated genomes and determine whether 1 or more outbreaks are likely to be taking place. To make things faster for this practical, we have provided pre-inferred genome assemblies (generated using shovill with the skesa assembler). You can infer the 7-gene MLST using the pubMLST Staphylococcus aureus scheme by running the mlst tool on each of the genome assemblies. mkdir -p outbreak_cluster_identification; cd outbreak_cluster_identification mlst --scheme saureus ../assemblies/*.fa &gt; mlst.tsv Now download the mlst.tsv output file (using either scp or the IP address listed above) and open it in your tabular data tool of choice (e.g., pandas/python, R, excel). Based on these results, which genomes do you suspect may not be part of this outbreak? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer P27 &amp; P28 have different MLSTs (ST1 and ST8) to any other genome so unlikely to be linked to an outbreak. P29 &amp; P34-38 (with P37 a partial match) could be an ST22 outbreak. P30-33 could be an ST772 outbreak. All remaining isolates belong to a large ST2731 set Why might genomes with a different MLST still be closely related or those with the same MLST be relatively unrelated? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer MLST are only 7 genes so a small amount of mutation (or conservation!) in just these genes can lead to a totally different MLST - schemes are designed to try and be robust but are mutation is a random process with high variance! We could solve this challenge using a more fine-grained scheme like cg/wgMLST (as discussed in the previous module) but we are going to use poppunk in this lab. poppunk is a rapid k-mer based genome clustering tool that groups genomes together based on both their core and accessory genome distances. This allows differential clustering of similar genomes which have acquired novel plasmids and so on. The developers of poppunk provide some pre-computed databases (although it is relatively easy to create your own) for different species which are available here. We have already downloaded a reference database for you, so all you have to do is prepare a 2-column file genomes.txt which has a series of names in the first column and the path to the related genome assembly in the other. We can do this using a quick bash one-line loop: for i in ../assemblies/*.fa; do isolate=$(echo $i | cut -d &#39;/&#39; -f3 | cut -d &#39;.&#39; -f1); echo -e &quot;$isolate\\t$i&quot; &gt;&gt; genomes.txt; done Then we can run the following to get poppunk cluster assignments: poppunk_assign --db ~/CourseData/module4/staphylococcus_aureus_v1_full --query genomes.txt --output poppunk Now download/inspect poppunk/poppunk_clusters.csv file Which genomes does this analysis suggest should be excluded? Do they match the MLST results? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer P27-28 are assigned to cluster 1 and P30-33 are assigned cluster 12. Remaining samples are assigned to cluster 3. P27 and P28 were different singleton STs for MLST that share a few alleles so supports eliminating them P30-33 were ST772 so poppunk and MLST agree and support eliminating these samples (although they could be their own distinct outbreak) ST22 and ST2731 isolates were both assigned to cluster 3. If we look carefully at the MLST profile for these STs in mlst.tsv we can see that these STs only differ by a single allele (arcC) so could be linked in the main outbreak. We can’t be sure about cluster 3 without further analysis but we can drop cluster 1 and 12 for now. SNP Analysis Now that we have eliminated some isolates that are unlikely to be connected to our main outbreak we can do a deeper analysis of the evolutionary relationships between our isolates. For this we are going to perform a phylogenetic analysis. There are several way this could be done: Inferring and aligning the core genome of our isolates by running a tool like panaroo on the genome assembly annotation files (generated with prokka or bakta). Mapping individual reads against a reference genome with a tool like snippy. Mapping SNPs between genomes using ska (then using a reference to order these SNPs) For SNP analyses, why might we want use a reference derived from an outbreak isolate instead of standard species reference genome? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer We maximise the number of detectable SNPs by using a reference as close as possible to our other genomes For this lab, we are going to do the last option using a complete high quality reference genome generated from this outbreak subsequent to the original manuscript: SASCBU26 First let’s generate the input file for SKA using the poppunk results cd ~/workspace/module4; mkdir -p ska_phylogeny; cd ska_phylogeny paste &lt;(grep &quot;3$&quot; ../outbreak_cluster_identification/poppunk/poppunk_clusters.csv | cut -d, -f1) &lt;(grep &quot;3$&quot; ../outbreak_cluster_identification/poppunk/poppunk_clusters.csv | cut -d, -f1 | perl -ne &#39;chomp; print &quot;../assemblies/$_.fa\\n&quot;&#39; ) &gt; ska_input echo -e &quot;SASCBU26\\t../SASCBU26_reference.fna&quot; &gt;&gt; ska_input Now we need to generate an SKA index: ska build -f ska_input -k 31 -o ska_index --threads 4 Then map these split k-mers against the reference (required to order them for the next step): ska map -o ska.aln --ambig-mask ../SASCBU26_reference.fna ska_index.skf This gives us an alignment but due the distorting effects of recombination we typically want to try and remove any potential recombinant sites from the alignment. There are several tools that can help us do this (verticall, ClonalFrameML, gubbins) and today we are going to use gubbins. mkdir -p gubbins run_gubbins.py --prefix gubbins/gubbins ska.aln mask_gubbins_aln.py --aln ska.aln --gff gubbins/gubbins.recombination_predictions.gff --out gubbins.masked.aln Now that we have a masked alignment gubbins.masked.aln we can analyse the SNP network using GraphSNP to further refine our potential outbreak samples. First, generate a SNP distance matrix using snp-dists: snp-dists gubbins.masked.aln | sed &#39;s/\\t/,/g&#39; &gt; raw_outbreak_matrix.csv Now download the raw_outbreak_matrix.csv, navigate to GraphSNP in your browser, and upload the raw_outbreak_matrix.csv as your Alignment/matrix. Then click on “Graph” at the top of the page (may be hidden behind 3 horizontal lines on smaller screens), increase your “Cutoff number” to 50, and then hit the “Create Graph” button. This will create a minimum spanning tree grouped using a 50 SNP cut-off. Which genomes do you think you can eliminate from being part of these immediate outbreak cluster? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer Based on the graph, isolates P29 &amp; P34-P38 can be eliminated. These were the ST22 isolates identified by mlst that poppunk convinced us to look at a bit more closely. We can see the closest is only ~80 SNPs from our outbreak cluster. Let’s also look at these isolates using a traditional phylogenetic approach. Go back to the server and run the following command to build a maximum-likelihood tree using iqtree: iqtree -s gubbins.masked.aln This will generate a lot of outputs but if you download the newick formatted phylogeny gubbins.masked.aln.treefile and go to microreact we can visualise the tree. Hit the “Upload” button and select your treefile. Then hit the settings slider icon at the top right Finally, select radial/unrooted tree. Does the phylogeny show the same genomes as being outside the main outbreak cluster &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer Yes, P37 &amp; P38 are close to the main outbreak cluster and could be included but for now we will exclude them. Now we have refined our final set of suspected outbreak isolates we can create our final alignment of just these sequences. Create a SNP distance matrix and phylogeny for just the final outbreak isolates by repeating the above steps with a modified ska_input (if you create a new folder you’ll avoid getting mixed up with your new datas). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If stuck/time-crunched A pre-computed distance matrix and phylogeny can be copied from ~/CourseData/module4/refined_outbreak_matrix.csv and ~/CourseData/module4/refined.gubbins.masked.aln.treefile ### Transmission Inference With our refined outbreak distance matrix and phylogeny we are going to perform some transmission analyses by combining these with some of our context data. First we are going to use the SeqTrack method as implemented in GraphSNP. To do this download contextual_metadata.csv and your refined distance matrix (e.g., refined_outbreak_matrix.csv or whatever you have named it) and then navigate to GraphSNP. This time you must upload the new distance matrix under Alignment/matrix and the metadata table under Metadata. Then navigate to “Graph” but this time select analysis type “transmission” and click “Create Graph” Which person is inferred to have infected the largest number of other patients? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer P8 or P4 Which baby/babies was/were inferred to be infected by a parent? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer P13 and P15 Congratulations you’ve performed your first transmission analysis! The next step would be to try and perform a more sophisticated transmission inference method using TransPhylo. However, this would require us to infer a time-scaled phylogeny and you’ll discover more about how to do that in the next module!

Introduction 1.1. Background 1.2. Objectives of this analysis: 1.3. What statistical approach is best?", " 1. Introduction 1.1. Background SARS-CoV-2 Pango lineage B.1.1.7 (Rambaut et al. 2020) was the first officially designated variant of concern (VOC) by the World Health Organization (Konings et al. 2021), due to its increased transmissibility compared to other circulating lineages. Although B.1.1.7 was discovered in December 2020, it originated in the months preceding that. For a more thorough investigation into the circumstances of B.1.1.7 discovery and emergence, see (Hill et al., 2022) on “The origins and molecular evolution of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 in the UK”. Evaluating when and where (and in what host, for multi-host pathogens) novel lineages or variants with increased transmissibility or virulence emerge is important towards improving our understanding of the conditions supporting the emergence of variants against which pharmaceutical (vaccines, therapies) or non-pharmaceutical interventions may be less effective. In this tutorial, we will analyze early SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 sequences and associated metadata from the first months following its detection to reconstruct its likely time and place of origin using phylodynamics and phylogeography, in both maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistical frameworks. 1.2. Objectives of this analysis: Download and clean publicly available SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 sequences Remove sequences with incomplete sample dates and subsample fewer sequences (keeping earliest with higher probability) Align sequences and filter out low-quality sequences Summarize the spatiotemporal distribution of samples Infer a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree (divergence tree) Infer a maximum likelihood time-scaled tree using a molecular clock model Conduct ancestral state reconstruction to identify the most likely geographic origin of lineage B.1.1.7 Compare the maximum likelihood estimates to those obtained in a Bayesian framework using Delphy 1.3. What statistical approach is best? Maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches to phylodynamics and phylogeography differ in their assumptions, algorithms, computational speed, scalability, and interpretation. For large scale analyses (&gt;10,000 sequences), maximum likelihood pipelines implemented in augur, treetime, iqtree, and R package ape, are more feasible, while analyses of smaller datasets (up to ~1000 sequences) can be done using Bayesian frameworks implemented in Delphy and BEAST, with the added benefits of incorporating uncertainty in the tree inference in parameter estimation and of specifying priors to limit the search space. If you are interested in exploring more complex applications and methods for phylodynamic analyses, I recommend checking out resources from the “Taming the BEAST” workshops that are held semi-regularly, as well as he tutorials shared by the BEAST Developers. Paul Lewis’ phyloseminar.org lectures on Bayesian phylogenetics (part 1 and part 2) are also an excellent place to start to learn the basic theory of Bayesian methods. Let’s go.

To find your IP address you can run: Commands curl http://checkip.amazonaws.com This should print a number like XX.XX.XX.XX.

In addition, the link precomputed-analysis will contain all the files we will generate during this lab (phylogenetic trees, etc). 3.4. Inspect and clean data The first step of any phylogenetic analysis is to inspect and clean the dataset. Initial cleaning (before even looking at the sequence quality) steps include checking that accessions and sequence names are complete and unique, checking the completeness of sampling dates and locations (especially in phylodynamic analyses where these play a central role), checking the range of dates are realistic, and looking at how many geographic categories there are and whether some are more well-represented than others. Run the following Rscript in the command line to de-duplicate seqeunces, remove incomplete dates, and subsample the data. Commands Rscript scripts/dedup_comp_dates.R &quot;data/download/b117_seq.csv&quot; &quot;data/download/b117_seq.fasta&quot; While this is running, let’s have a look inside the R script. Open the .Rproj file in RStudio, then open scripts/dedup_comp_dates.R. Note that while we have called this script from the command line, you can also run it within Rstudio by manually specifying the arguments. What is happening inside this script: De-duplicate identical sequences (taking earliest collection date of replicates) Rename sequences without any spaces and add sequence name to metadata Identify and remove incomplete collection date (yyyy or yyyy-mm) Create a smaller subsampled dataset ‘complete_sampUK’ with equal number of non-UK and UK samples NOTE: this is the dataset that we will be working with in this lab due to limited time. In a more robust analysis, we would include more samples, repeat sampling with different seeds, and rather than sampling at random, we might consider sampling proportionally to geographies’ diagnosed cases through time to more accurately reflect spatiotemporal dynamics Export fasta and csv files into data/complete subfolder How many sequences were downloaded? How many sequences were there after de-duplicating? After de-duplicating, how many had complete dates? How many were sampled (sampUK)?

Maximum likelihood phylodynamic analysis The overall goal of this lab is to estimate where and when B.1.1.7 most likely originated. To do this, we will mostly make use of the Augur maximum likelihood tool suite, which powers the NextStrain website. Within augur, the key tool actually being used for most of our inferences is TreeTime a likelihood based tool for inferring molecular clocks and ancestral traits. An overview of the basic usage of Augur (figure from the Augur documentation): The steps/functions we use are in this section of the lab are the following: align: This step constructs a multiple sequence alignment from this subset of genomes. index: This step indexes the sequences, counting the frequency of nucleotides and gaps. filter: This step filters out sequences that have too many gaps or ambiguous nucleotides. tree: This step builds a phylogenetic tree, where branch lengths are measured in substitutions/site (a divergence tree). refine: This step constructs a time tree using our existing tree alongside collection dates of SARS-CoV-2 genomic samples (branch lengths are measured in time). traits: This step uses treetime’s mugration model to infer ancestral traits based on the tree. We will use this to infer ancestral host and geography. export: This step exports the data to be used by Auspice, a version of the visualization system used by NextStrain that lets you examine your own phylogenetic tree and metadata. 4.1. Construct a multiple sequence alignment of the genomes (augur align) The first step is to construct a multiple sequence alignment of the genomes, which is required before building a phylogenetic tree. We will be using the command augur align to accomplish this task, but underneath this mafft runs to construct the alignment. To build a new folder and construct the alignment, please run the following: Commands mkdir data/aligned augur align --nthreads 2 --sequences data/complete/b117_seq_complete_sampUK.fasta --reference-sequence data/download/MN908947.3.fasta --output data/aligned/b117_seq_complete_sampUK_aligned.fasta You should expect to see the following: Output using mafft to align via: mafft --reorder --anysymbol --nomemsave --adjustdirection --thread 2 data/b117_seq_complete_sampUK_aligned.fasta.to_align.fasta 1&gt; data/b117_seq_complete_sampUK_aligned.fasta 2&gt; data/b117_seq_complete_sampUK_aligned.fasta.log Katoh et al, Nucleic Acid Research, vol 30, issue 14 https://doi.org/10.1093%2Fnar%2Fgkf436 WARNING: 1bp insertion at ref position 200 was due to &#39;N&#39;s or &#39;?&#39;s in provided sequences WARNING: 1bp insertion at ref position 6337 was due to &#39;N&#39;s or &#39;?&#39;s in provided sequences Trimmed gaps in MN908947.3|China|2019-12-26 from the alignment The meaning of each parameter: `–nthreads: Number of threads for the alignment. `–sequences: The input set of sequences in FASTA format. `–output: The output alignment, in FASTA format. `–reference-sequence: The reference genome (MN908947.3==Wuhan-Hu-1). The reference sequence will be included in our alignment and augur align removes any insertions with respect to this reference genome (useful when identifying and naming specific mutations later on in the augur pipeline). The aligned fasta file is a very similar format as the input file, but the difference is that sequences have been aligned (possibly by inserting gaps -). This also means that all sequences in alignment.fasta should have the same length (whereas sequences in sequences.fasta, which is not aligned, may have different lengths). When time allows, it is good practice to visually inspect the alignment in a viewer such as AliView. 4.2. Index sequences (augur index) This step is optional but useful to inspect sequence quality and quicken the subsequent filtering step, by counting the frequency of nucleotides and gaps. Commands augur index --sequences data/aligned/b117_seq_complete_sampUK_aligned.fasta --output data/aligned/b117_seq_complete_sampUK_aligned_sequence_index.tsv Inspect the index output in the ‘aligned’ subfolder. Knowing that the genome size is 29,903 bp, do any samples appear to have more gaps or Ns than you would expect? At first glance, none appear to have &gt;~3000 gaps or Ns. 4.3. Filter out low quality sequences (augur filter) Filter seqs to a minimum length (–min-length) of 26913, which represents 90% of 29,903 sites with ACTG (i.e., max 10% ambig and gaps) Commands mkdir data/filtered augur filter --nthreads 2 --sequences data/aligned/b117_seq_complete_sampUK_aligned.fasta --metadata data/complete/b117_seq_complete_sampUK.tsv --sequence-index data/aligned/b117_seq_complete_sampUK_aligned_sequence_index.tsv --min-length 26913 --output-sequences data/filtered/b117_seq_complete_sampUK_aligned_filt.fasta --output-metadata data/filtered/b117_seq_complete_sampUK_filt.tsv Output 1 strain was dropped during filtering 1 had no metadata (this is the refence sequence) 178 strains passed all filters Nice, all the sequences passed our quality filters (this is rarer than you might think). Why is it important to remove low quality sequences prior to phylogenetic inference? The choice of maximum 10% ambiguous and gaps seems (is) somewhat arbitrary. How would increasing or decreasing this threshold change the analysis? Sequences with excessive gaps or ambiguous sites may not have as high of accuracy, and have less signal to contribute to the tree, which could bias its placement. Increasing the threshold would allow more sequences of lower quality to pass through the filter. Decreasing the threshold is more conservative. 4.4. Mask problematic sites in the alignment Not all sites in the genome are equally informative towards inferring their phylogenetic relationships. Some sites can be misleading and should be masked before building trees. The ends of alignments often exhibit low coverage and a higher rate of sequencing or mapping errors. In SARS-CoV-2, this includes positions 1–55 and 29804–29903. Homoplasic sites at which multiple recurrent mutations arise may reflect contamination, recurrent sequencing errors, or hypermutability. Even if they are accurate, they may not be representative of evolution across the remainder of the genome. Another example (not relevant here) would be sites at which drug resistance mutations occur. In HIV-1 phylodynamic analyses, codons of surveillance drug resistance mutations are masked. For further interest, see this justification for masking SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Note that augur also has a masking subcommand, but it requires the mask file to be in a different format, so we’re not using it here. Instead, we’re going to run a python script that masks sequences based on a vcf (Variant Call Format) file of problematic sites. In order to run this, we have to concatenate the reference sequence back into the fasta, which was filtered out by augur above. Then we’re going to run our masking script, and then remove that reference again. Commands mkdir data/masked ## Concatenate the fasta with the reference fasta cat data/filtered/b117_seq_complete_sampUK_aligned_filt.fasta data/download/MN908947.3.fasta &gt; data/filtered/b117_seq_complete_sampUK_aligned_filt_ref.fasta ## Run the masking python script python3 scripts/mask_alignment_using_vcf.py -i data/filtered/b117_seq_complete_sampUK_aligned_filt_ref.fasta -o data/masked/b117_seq_complete_sampUK_aligned_filt_ref_mask.fasta -v scripts/problematic_sites_vcfv5.vcf -n &quot;n&quot; --reference_id &quot;MN908947.3|China|2019-12-26&quot; ## Remove the reference sequence from the alignment using augur filter augur filter --sequences data/masked/b117_seq_complete_sampUK_aligned_filt_ref_mask.fasta --metadata data/filtered/b117_seq_complete_sampUK_filt.tsv --output-sequences data/masked/b117_seq_complete_sampUK_aligned_filt_mask.fasta --output-metadata data/masked/b117_seq_complete_sampUK_aligned_filt_mask.tsv The $cat command is a simple and useful tool to concatenate multiple fasta files together.

Build a maximum liklihood phylogenetic tree (augur tree) The next step is to take the set of aligned genomes and build a phylogenetic tree (a divergence tree in units of substitutions per site). We will use augur tree for this, but underneath it (by default) runs iqtree, which uses maximum likelihood to infer a phylogenetic tree. Commands mkdir trees augur tree --nthreads 4 --method iqtree --substitution-model GTR --alignment data/masked/b117_seq_complete_sampUK_aligned_filt_mask.fasta --output trees/b117_seq_complete_sampUK_aligned_filt_mask.tre Let’s check out the parameters --nthreads: Number of threads --method: The tree inference method.

Note: For this lab we are not looking at branch support values for a tree, but for real-world analysis you may wish to look into including (ultra-fast) bootstrap support values or approximate likelihood ratio test values. This will give a measure of how well-supported each branch in the tree is by the alignment (often a number from 0 for little support to 100 for maximal support). Please see the IQTree documentation for more details. 4.6. Inferring timing of host change (augur refine) The tree output by iqtree shows hypothetical evolutionary relationships between different SARS-CoV-2 genomes with branch lengths representing distances between different genomes (in units of substitutions/site, i.e., the predicted number of substitutions between genomes divided by the alignment length). However, other methods of measuring distance between genomes are possible. In particular we can incorporate the collection dates of the different SARS-CoV-2 genomes to infer a tree where branches are scaled according to the elapsed time and the dates of internal nodes are inferred. Such trees are called time trees or time-scaled phylogenies. We will use TreeTime invoked by augur to infer a time tree from our phylogenetic tree using collection dates of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes stored in the metadata file. We will use the augur refine step to run TreeTime and perform some additional refinemint of the tree. To do this, please run the following: Commands augur refine --alignment data/masked/b117_seq_complete_sampUK_aligned_filt_mask.fasta --tree trees/b117_seq_complete_sampUK_aligned_filt_mask.tre --metadata data/masked/b117_seq_complete_sampUK_aligned_filt_mask.tsv --timetree --divergence-units mutations --output-tree trees/b117_seq_complete_sampUK_aligned_filt_mask_timetree.tre --output-node-data trees/refine.node.json --seed 123 --stochastic-resolve --root least-squares --date-confidence --clock-rate 4.5e-4 --clock-std-dev 0.2 Once again, let’s have a closer look at the parameters: --alignment: The alignment used to build the tree. Used to re-scale the divergence units. --tree: The starting input tree built using iqtree3. --metadata: The metadata which contains the SARS-CoV-2 genome names (in a column called name) and the sample collection dates (in a column named date). --timetree: Specifiy to build a time tree. --divergence-units: Convert the branch lengths of substitutions/site (mutations/site) to mutations (not needed to build a time tree, this is just used for visualizing the tree later on). --output-tree: The output Newick file containing the time tree. --output-node-data: Augur will store additional information here which will let us convert between time trees and substitution trees. --seed: Set a seed for reproducibility --stochastic-resolve: Resolve polytomies stochastically (forces a bifurcating tree) --root: choose root that optimizes the least squares for the root-to-tip regression -date-confidence --clock-rate: We are specifying a relaxed molecular clock rate, with a mean of 4.5e-4 based on Hill et al. 2022 --clock-std-dev: This is the deviance on the relaxed clock, allowing for variable evolutionary rates across the tree.

If you want, download the time tree and view it in icytree. Optional If you have spare time at the end of the lab, consider returning to conduct a sensitivity analysis on the specified clock rate and variance. 4.7. Infer ancestral states for host and location (augur traits) We will now be using treetime’s mugration model to reconstruct discrete ancestral states. In other words, we are trying to use the tree and genome metadata to reconstruct the most likely country at each of the internal nodes in the tree. It is called a mugration model because it is fundamentally estimating migration between “demes” (in this case, countries) as if it were a substitution rate matrix, commonly referred to as mu. See Lemey et al. 2009 if you’re interested in learning more. Side bar: discrete phylogeography, ancestral state reconstruction, ancestral trait inference, and ancestral character estimation can all be used interchangeably in this context. As with the other analyses, augur makes this process very convenient: Commands augur traits --tree trees/b117_seq_complete_sampUK_aligned_filt_mask_timetree.tre --metadata data/masked/b117_seq_complete_sampUK_aligned_filt_mask.tsv --columns Country Geo_Location --output-node-data trees/trait.node.json The parameters we used are: --tree: The time-calibrated tree we inferred in step 4 --metadata: The metadata file with information about the genomes in the tree --columns: The columns in the metadata file we want to infer ancestral states for, in this case country and geo_location (more specific info). --output-node-data: Augur stores the additional information related to the ancestral trait inference for later visualisation.

Visualizing the phylodynamic analysis Now that we’ve constructed and packaged up a tree (analysis-package.json), we can visualize this data alongside the data augur has extracted from our metadata using augur and Auspice.

Next, navigate to https://auspice.us/ and drag the file analysis-package.json onto the page. 5.2. Explore data Spend some time to explore the data and get used to the Auspice interface. Try switching between different Tree Layouts, Branch Lengths, or colouring the tree by different criteria in the metadata table. This is always worth doing a bit before diving into analyses. Scroll down and hit download to save the outputs of this for future reference. The nexus trees contain the internal node states along with the tree, so is readable into R and FigTree if you want to customize the tree more or analyze ancestral state transitions to identify sublineages or calculate dispersion rates etc. 5.3. Examine the molecular clock Now we are going to look more at the Branch length “TIME” and “DIVERGENCE” option. First, let’s look at the divergence tree and use the x-axis to work out how many mutations there are on certain branches. We can use the x-axis in the “RECTANGULAR” layout of the “DIVERGENCE” tree to work this out or we can directly move our cursor over the node/branch of interest to have a pop-up with the details. The mutation tree: Now, we can do the same thing if we switch to “TIME” and look at the approximate inferred dates of the internal nodes of the tree. We can also mouse over to get the exact pop-up dates. What was the maximum number of mutations from the root to any tip? What was the most likely date of the root (AKA the time of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA)) ? Confidence interval? How do you interpret the root of this phylogeny? Is it representative of the entire B.1.1.7 lineage? 18 (to tip MW598424.1/Ghana/2020-12-22). This tip could be considered a temporal outlier and excluded from the analysis. 2020-08-21, but the confidence interval is wide and lower bound is unrealistic (2016-05-31 - 2020-09-12) This root is the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of a random sample of early B.1.1.7 sequences, downsampling the UK samples to an equal number as non-UK samples. It may not be fully representative of the full diversity of early B.1.1.7, nor later evolution of B.1.1.7. Now, have a look at the “CLOCK” layout/figure found in the options bar on the left of your screen. This brings up a root-to-tip regression from the divergence tree (i.e., how many mutations from root to tip, versus collection date). You can click on individual points (including the upper outlier from Ghana) to see the average substitution rate for that tip. for that tip. The root-to-tip regression plot: What is the slope of the root-to-tip regression (in subs/year; subs/site/year)? What does it represent? Does the trend line for the root-to-tip regression look like a good fit with good temporal signal? Given the data and trendline, how accurate do you think the inferred root date is? How might you estimate the uncertainty in these estimates? 14.9 substitutions per year. Or (ignoring masked sites), 14.9/29903=0.0004982778=5.0 subs/site/year. It represents the strict molecular clock rate. Aside from the outlier, it looks like a good fit (an R-squared value should really be reported) with reasonable temporal signal. The confidence interval on the root is wide, we have a relatively small (singular) sample, but the linear fit is decent and we included early samples with higher probabilities, so I’d say medium to low accuracy for the mean estimate. Multiple subsamples of higher sample sizes. Bootstrapping/ultrafast bootstrapping. Multiple clock rate assumptions when inferring the time tree. 5.4. Examine the ancestral state reconstruction We can colour the tree and rename the tree tip labels using the metadata to reflect the ancestral state reconstruction. The internal nodes/branches will be coloured based on the inferred ancestral state, in this case Country or Geo_location. Investigate the ancestral states at internal nodes throughout the tree including at the root. Use the play button to visualize the dispersion globally. Here is a look at what you should be seeing in auspice when you change branches to be colored by Country and choose the multi-panel layout. Based on this analysis, where was the root of B.1.1.7 likely to have occurred? How do you think sequence subsampling might have impacted this analysis? What additional data would give you more confidence in asserting where this lineage was likely to have originated? How could you use the output of this analysis to quantify viral dispersion? The United Kingdom We included far fewer sequences from the UK than were available, and still inferred it as the likely origin. It would be worth comparing other sampling schemes to validate this, but we have high confidence that this was the likely origin, given the sequences publicly available. More early B.1.1.7 sequences from other countries would be informative. Also, including close parental or sister lineages (like B.1 similar to B.1.1.7) of similar time/place could add resolution to the analysis. Quantify importation or exportation rates by country through time. You could also incorporate population size, connectivity (mobility data), geographical distance, and other factors to evaluate (or control for) factors associated with elevated dispersal. That’s that for our maximum likelihood phylogeographic inference. Now, we’re going to compare those results to a Bayesian approach. "],["delphy-analysis.html", "6. Delphy analysis 6.1. Modify fasta names, then load the renamed fasta into Delphy 6.2. Modify priors by clicking on advanced options 6.3. Run the analysis and interpret output 6.4. Export results", " 6. Delphy analysis Delphy is a newly released Bayesian phylogenetics tool designed to be fast, scalable, accessible, and accurate. Delphy is faster than other Bayesian tools because it uses Explicit Mutation-Annotated Trees (EMAT), which are hypotheses of how an ancestral sequence replicated and evolved, mutation by mutation, into the observed dated sequences. Check out their pre-print if you want more details. In Bayesian phylogenetic (and phylodynamic) inference, many models (made up of trees and parameters) are sampled to generate posterior probability distributions, and our estimates will reflect the highest posterior density (HPD). Bayesian analyses differ from max likelihood approaches in that they incorporate uncertainty from the tree inference and sampling process, and rely on specification of prior probabilities for the parameters to be explored using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which is basically a hill-climbing algorithm that suggests and compares models compared to the previous step. Model convergence is assessed using minimum effective sampling size (ESS) reflects and in robust analyses is usually ~200 after removing the burn-in. Burn-in are steps that you don’t include in the final posterior distributions because they represent the model stabilization period. In a robust Bayesian analyses, multiple MCMC chains are run, and then combined after burn-in. The tree displayed reflects a maximum clade credibility tree, which is a single tree with the highest posterior probability across the Bayesian posterior distribution of trees. Branch width represents the credibility threshold, more commonly referred to as posterior support or probability, which indicate the strength of evidence for clades, given the data and model used. 6.1. Modify fasta names, then load the renamed fasta into Delphy Delphy wants sequence names to include info separated by “|” not “/”, so we’ll start by running a simple R script to rename the relevant fasta and metadata. Run this Rscript in the command line. You can go to scripts/convert_names.R to have a look at what this script does, but it’s pretty simple. Rscript scripts/convert_names.R &quot;data/masked/b117_seq_complete_sampUK_aligned_filt_mask.tsv&quot; &quot;data/masked/b117_seq_complete_sampUK_aligned_filt_mask.fasta&quot; The renamed files output goes to a newly created folder, data/delphy. Now, open the Delphy web browser and drag/drop or upload the fasta file data/delphyb117_seq_complete_sampUK_aligned_filt_mask_delphy.fasta. 6.2. Modify priors by clicking on advanced options Leave the sampling frequency to sample 1 tree per 1,000,000 steps. You could change this to sample more frequently if you want, but this might not improve the speed of convergence if trees are too similar to each other. Let’s modify the priors. It is important to assess and modify priors in Bayesian analyses to reflect your prior expectations and narrow the parameter space explored. Improper priors not only slow down convergence, but can bias analyses. For mutation rate: enable site rate heterogeneity fix overall (mean) mutation rate set initial mutation rate to 45e-5 s/s/y 4.5e-4 (Hill et al. 2022) Population model Choose skygrid (these are both coalescent tree priors. Delphy does not have birth-death models like BEAST does.) model start date 2020-01-01 (the earliest this lineage root could have occurred) split into 10 intervals keep other parameters the same (could play with advanced skygrid parameters) Further reading on the choice of population model Here is a look at the advanced options you should be modifying. This should also have had split into 10 intervals. Before we start the run, go to Customize in the toolbar, then add the metadata file data/delphyb117_seq_complete_sampUK_aligned_filt_mask_delphy.tsv by drag/drop then in Color system, click metadata, color by Country, then select all. Delphy customize options: what biases may we have imposed through our selection of priors? We may bias our estimates of the root date by specifying an improper mean molecular clock rate. The skygrid may not fit well with 10 categories (not enough data in early period). The underlying population may be better described by the exponential population distribution. Any misspecified or over-generalized prior has the potential to bias the analysis or underestimate the true uncertainty in the estimates. 6.3. Run the analysis and interpret output Hit play and watch in statistical awe as trees sampled from the posterior are displayed in real-time, alongside model parameters including the number of mutations, ln(posterior), total evolutionary time (tree height), and effective population size in years. We can start to investigate the output before the run is complete (or you can upload the precomputed-analysis/trees/delphy_out/.delphy file directly to the Delphy home page to analyze a more complete analysis of &gt;300 million steps). Here is a look at the more complete run, including a sampled tree, the MCC tree, and the posterior distribution of some key model parameters. Although Delphy does not seem very good at estimating the ESS and assessing convergence, a good sign of convergence is when the posterior distributions of parameters appear as “fuzzy caterpillars” (converging around similar values, as opposed to jumping around). How do you interpret the change in effective population size through time? Did your model converge? How can you tell? The effective population size is low and then increases rapidly (exponentially?) as this lineage transmitted broadly in the UK and globally, but then appears to decrease at the end of the study perio, but this likely reflects lower sampling rate towards the end of the period. After removing burn-in, the ESS for the parameters shown are below 200, so probably not. We would have to run this for more steps, and maybe for multiple chains that we could combine using a tool like Tracer. NEXT, let’s click on Lineages in the upper tool bar. In the bottom left corner, you can change branch coloring between Credibility and Metadata (Country). You can also change the credibility threshold (posterior support) for nodes’/branches’ shading in the tree displayed. Is the first bifurcation at the root well-supported? What is the median posterior root date? No, the credibility threshold is &lt;50%. Median posterior root date ~19 July 2020. Normally a 95% HPD should be reported, but Delphy does not show that directly. If you have time/interest, you can read the exported data into R and estimate the uncertainty. And now click on Mutations in the upper tool bar. Click on recurrent mutations, then A17615G. This mutation may have evolved independently multiple times, though it was only found in 70 genomes. It is a non-synonymous mutation in the ORF1b gene, resulting in an amino acid change of Lysine to Arginine (K1383R) in the nsp10 protein. Explore the other mutations that occurred in the phylogeny. Where does the Delphy analysis suggest the root of this B.1.1.7 phylogeny occurred? Does the Bayesian analysis corroborate the maximum likelihood analysis in terms of the time and place of origin of B.1.1.7? The UK Yes! Both the Bayesian and ML analyses suggest this lineage originated around August 20, 2020 in the UK. This is very close to the estimate from Hill et al. 2022 of a “TMRCA of the Alpha clade estimated at 28 August 2020 (95 % HPD: 15th August 2020 to 9th September 2020)”. 6.4. Export results To wrap this Delphy analysis up, go to Customize, then in the bottom left, export the Tree as png and Newick file, and the Delphy run. The Delphy run file can be dropped back into Delphy or read into R. You can also generate input/output to BEAST to run a more bespoke Bayesian analysis. "],["end-of-lab.html", "7. End of lab", " 7. End of lab You’ve made it to the end of the lab. Awesome job. treat If you have some extra time, you can explore Auspice or Delphy further, or see how the results differ if you change the subsampling scheme or the clock rate. Another fun activity would be to read the Delphy output into R and summarize the median and 95% highest posterior distribution of the root date, "]]
